# Ollivander's Wand Shop

As a second assignment during "Android Development for Beginners" scholarship by Udacity and Google, 
I needed to implement a single screen app that displays information about a fictional small business.

I've decided to implement an app about Ollivander's Wand Shop.

My app is including all details that were required:
* Business name
* Photos, which are representing the business
* Contact information (phone number, website)
* Address of the Business
* Description of business
* Hours of operation

Moreover, I implemented interaction with user:
* Call button will open a phone app and dial a phone number from contact information
* Save button will show a toast message
* Website button will open a web page in a browser
* If you'll click on an Address it'll open a maps app with place's address.
* If you'll click on a Phone number it will open a phone app and dial a phone number
* Opening hours also showing is a place opened right now or not.
